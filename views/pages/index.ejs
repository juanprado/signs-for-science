    <h3>A creative brief for science & the climate</h3>
    <p class="col-8">Use your powers of creation for something amazing. Let’s come up with sign ideas for the March for Science on April 22, and the People’s Climate March on April 29. Make them clever, provocative and inclusive, but always POSITIVE. No anti-Trump stuff, partisanship, or doom & gloom. Upload an image, or write a clever headline—and we’ll do the rest.</p>
